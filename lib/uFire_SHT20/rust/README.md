### What it is

An SHT20 sensor in a plastic enclosure with a 1m length of cable.

The device uses the Qwiic Connect System for wiring, it's an easy-to-use, polarized, push-to-fit connector. No more mistaken connections or soldering header pins.

### Using it

There is plenty of [documentation](/docs/uFire_SHT20/) on the [specification](/docs/uFire_SHT20/#characteristics), and [setup](/docs/uFire_SHT20/#getting-started) of the sensor.

#### Running this example
From the /rust folder, type `cargo run`. You may run into permission issues and need to run the executable with sudo. `sudo ./target/debug/ufire_sht20_bin`. You'll be presented with a `> ` prompt. Type `help` and you'll get a list of commands you can run.
